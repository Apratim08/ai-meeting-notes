# Comprehensive Error Handling and Recovery Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the comprehensive error handling and recovery mechanisms implemented for the AI Meeting Notes application. The implementation addresses all requirements from task 10 of the specification.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Retry Mechanisms with Preserved Intermediate Results

- **Automatic Retry Logic**: Each processing step (audio recording, transcription, notes generation) includes configurable retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
- **Intermediate Result Preservation**: When errors occur, all intermediate results (audio files, transcripts) are preserved for potential retry
- **Graceful Degradation**: System continues to function even when some components fail

### 2. User-Friendly Error Messages with Actionable Solutions

- **Categorized Errors**: Errors are categorized by type (audio device, transcription, notes generation, etc.)
- **Contextual Messages**: Error messages are tailored to the specific failure scenario
- **Recovery Guidance**: Each error includes specific recovery actions the user can take

### 3. Comprehensive Error Categories

The system handles the following error categories:

- **Audio Device Errors**: BlackHole not installed, device permissions, device busy
- **File System Errors**: Insufficient disk space, file permissions, corrupted files
- **Transcription Errors**: Model unavailable, processing failures, empty results
- **Notes Generation Errors**: Ollama unavailable, connection timeouts, model issues
- **Network Errors**: Connection failures, service unavailable
- **System Resource Errors**: Memory issues, disk space problems

## Implementation Details

### Error Handling Classes

#### ProcessingError
Enhanced exception class with:
- Error categorization and severity levels
- User-friendly messages separate from technical details
- Recovery action suggestions
- Context information (component, operation, session details)

#### ErrorRecoveryManager
Central error management with:
- Error history tracking
- Retry logic with configurable backoff strategies
- Recovery action generation
- Error categorization and user message generation

#### RetryConfig
Configurable retry behavior:
- Maximum attempts
- Exponential or linear backoff
- Jitter for avoiding thundering herd
- Per-operation customization

### Processing Pipeline Enhancements

The ProcessingPipeline class now includes:

1. **Enhanced Start Recording**:
   - Pre-flight checks for BlackHole availability
   - Disk space validation
   - Detailed error messages with setup instructions

2. **Robust Transcription Phase**:
   - File validation before processing
   - Retry logic with fallback models
   - Empty result detection and handling
   - Progress monitoring with error recovery

3. **Resilient Notes Generation**:
   - Ollama availability checking
   - Transcript length validation
   - Connection timeout handling
   - Retry mechanisms for temporary failures

4. **Recovery Methods**:
   - `retry_transcription()`: Retry failed transcription with preserved audio
   - `retry_notes_generation()`: Retry failed notes generation with preserved transcript
   - `execute_recovery_action()`: Execute user-selected recovery actions

### API Enhancements

Enhanced API endpoints with:

1. **Detailed Error Responses**:
   - Structured error information
   - Recovery action suggestions
   - Setup instructions for common issues

2. **New Recovery Endpoints**:
   - `/api/retry/{action}`: Execute recovery actions
   - `/api/error-summary`: Get error monitoring information
   - `/api/cleanup-old-files`: Manual file cleanup

3. **Enhanced Status Information**:
   - Error details in session status
   - Available recovery options
   - Processing progress with error context

## Configuration

Error handling behavior is configurable through:

### Retry Configurations
```python
retry_configs = {
    "transcription": RetryConfig(max_attempts=3, base_delay=2.0),
    "notes_generation": RetryConfig(max_attempts=2, base_delay=5.0),
    "audio_recording": RetryConfig(max_attempts=2, base_delay=1.0),
    "file_operations": RetryConfig(max_attempts=3, base_delay=0.5)
}
```

### Error Severity Levels
- **LOW**: Minor issues, system continues normally
- **MEDIUM**: Significant issues, some functionality affected
- **HIGH**: Major issues, core functionality affected
- **CRITICAL**: System cannot function

## Monitoring and Observability

### Error Tracking
- Error history with timestamps and context
- Error frequency and pattern analysis
- Recovery success/failure rates
- Performance impact monitoring

### User Feedback
- Clear error messages in UI
