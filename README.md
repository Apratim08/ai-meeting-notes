# AI Meeting Notes

An AI-powered meeting notes application that captures audio from system speakers and microphone, transcribes it to text, and exports to ChatGPT/Claude for structured meeting notes generation.

## Features

- Dual-stream audio capture from system speakers (via BlackHole) and microphone
- Real-time audio mixing with configurable gain
- High-quality transcription using faster-whisper
- One-click export to ChatGPT/Claude for AI-generated notes
- Simple web interface for monitoring and control
- Privacy-focused: transcription happens locally, you control what goes to cloud LLMs

## Setup Requirements

### macOS Audio Setup

1. **Install BlackHole** (virtual audio driver):
   - Download from: https://github.com/ExistentialAudio/BlackHole
   - Install BlackHole 2ch

2. **Create Multi-Output Device**:
   - Open Audio MIDI Setup app
   - Click "+" and select "Create Multi-Output Device"
   - Check both your speakers/headphones AND BlackHole 2ch
   - Set this as your system output during meetings

### Software Requirements

1. **Install Python 3.9+**

2. **Install Python dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Set your system audio output to the Multi-Output Device
2. Start the application:
   ```bash
   python -m ai_meeting_notes.main
   ```
3. Open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
4. Click "Start Recording" when your meeting begins
5. Click "Stop Recording" when the meeting ends
6. Wait for transcription to complete
7. Click "ðŸ“‹ Export for ChatGPT/Claude" to copy the prompt + transcript
8. Paste into ChatGPT or Claude to generate structured meeting notes

## Configuration

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and modify settings as needed:

```bash
# Audio settings
AUDIO_SAMPLE_RATE=16000
MIC_GAIN=0.5  # Microphone gain (0.0-2.0)

# Transcription settings
WHISPER_MODEL=base  # tiny, base, small, medium, large
TRANSCRIPTION_LANGUAGE=auto
```

```bash
pytest
```

Start development server with auto-reload:
```bash
uvicorn ai_meeting_notes.main:app --reload
```

## Why ChatGPT/Claude instead of local LLM?

- **Higher quality**: ChatGPT and Claude produce better structured notes
- **No GPU required**: No need for expensive local compute
- **Faster processing**: Cloud LLMs are optimized and fast
- **You control privacy**: Review the transcript before sending to cloud
- **Cost effective**: Pay only for what you use
